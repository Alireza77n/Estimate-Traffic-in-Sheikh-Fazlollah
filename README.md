# Estimate-Traffic-in-Sheikh-Fazlollah

One of the applications of recurrent neural networks is solving time series problems. In a time series, we have data that changes over time, and we want to
predict its value in the future.
In this context, we approach the problem of traffic estimation. In this application, finding a route with the minimum fuel/time consumption is a significant
issue, with its fundamental pillar being the estimation of these data.
In the upcoming task, we have data for a section of Sheikh Fazlollah East
highway. In each time interval, we have the duration it takes for a vehicle to
pass through this section. This data represents an average of the passage times
for users familiar with this section of the map.
